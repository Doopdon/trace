# trace
I am calling this tool "trace". why? because you should always be able to trace back to the issue. you should never see an error that disappears into 5 pages of minified code. 

It should do most of what react does when it is finished. and Idk what angular is doing except pissing me off but ima go out on a limb and say it can do angular stuff too.

to run the app cd into traceApp and run $ node index

you can also open the trace.html file in the demo folder in chrome to run a bunch of demos unconnected to a server.
