to run the app: open the trace.html file in the trace-app folder in a browser.

ABOUT

I am calling this tool "trace". why? because you should always be able to trace back to the issue. you should never see an error that disappears into 5 pages of minified code. 

It should do most of what react and angular does but faster and with a file size in the kilobytes.
